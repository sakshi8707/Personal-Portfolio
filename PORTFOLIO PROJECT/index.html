            Well, if it's not obvious by now from the site design philosophy, I am a programmer. Or atleast I choose to call myself one üòÅ
            </p>
            <p class="theme-light">
            At the time of writing, I am in the final year of my 4 year undergraduate degree course in EXTC engineering. Other than that, I am Competitive coder at Codechef,Leetcode and HackerRank.
          </p>
          <p class="theme-light">
            My life is pretty much engulfed by coding now. Basically, I am married to my laptop. If I'm not working on my laptop, I'm probably playing on it. I'm very into Valorant at the moment [// Riot is one hell of a studio]. If we share a common interest, ping me @sakshi8707 #sakshi_ttt
          </p>
          <p class="theme-light">
            I am also a huge music guy! If I'm married to my laptop then my headphone is my child [// This metaphor has been stretched as far as possible]. I have a huge playlist [// It's about 11h at the moment], which is mostly just Indian Indie and Desi Hip-Hop on spotify which you can find at the very end of this website. Sorting it in chronological order will show you as well as anyone can, the phases I've been through in life, lol.
          </p>
          <p class="theme-light">
  
            Surely, just like the rest, I also indulge in binge watching streaks. Netflix is a thing of beauty both from a technological and a content-based perspective. I find myself repeating my comfort shows and movies more than I turn to newer content but I do crack under peer pressure and find myself requiring to stay up to date on the latest exploits of the Starks and the Professor and other "Stranger Things".

        The content on the pill outside is pretty accurate, but don't count me out of a sprint writing session when I'm in my element.
        </p>
        <p class="theme-light">I've been writing for a long long time now. I started with random song lyrics. [// Way past being embarrassed now]. Then I moved to writing short poems and some coherent lyrics. Wrote a few magazine articles, mostly related to technical topics that caught my interest somehow [// Thanks to my Google Feed]. And most recently, I joined my college's Committee Club as a Technical Head , WebMaster and CodeXpert. I went on to become the lead scriptwriter for the gang and also performed in some inter-collegiate competitions where we crushed the competition.
      </p>
      <p class="theme-light">I had some great people guiding me along on this writing journey and I thank them all for inspiring me to write more and teaching me how to write well. I hope to find the time to continue writing whatever comes to the mind. Letting my imagination run away with them beautiful thoughts.

        <p class="theme-light">&#8226; Well, this website was my   dedicated hand at trying out Html , Css , JavaScript and Botrstrap at same. In modern JS , I have been a huge fan of Vue.js pretty much from its inception i used <code>particle.js</code>. But when JavaScript came up with Doms, it got me to turn my head around, much like the guy from the meme and this website told me just how much I've missed out on by not choosing core JavaScript. Well, better not to dwell on the past and look forward to a progressive web app development experience with JavaScript. [// See what I did there? :P]
          </p>
        <p class="theme-light">&#8226;
          Well, this website originally started out to be a simple socket demo application for me to try out socket.io library. What can I say, I was in my explore mode and although these technologies have been around quite some time, I got to it when I got time to get to it.

        <p class="theme-light">&#8226;You might have noticed the coming soon on the navigation if you are viewing this on a wide enough display [// sorry, not sorry]. I plan on adding some socket gaming there [// Already underway] and possibly a blog ü§û, so stay tuned...

        <p class="theme-light">That said I am grateful for a lot of things, prime among them being the era I have been born into. We are living in one of them most exciting periods to be living in [// Bested only by the Scientific Revolution and the Greek Renaissance in my mind]. I guess you could say that about any period depending on when you are born, but I believe we are at the precipice of achieving some mind boggling feats never before seen in human history. Sure, fire was praised as the greatest things humans discovered for a long long time, but have you ever heard of a tiny little thing called a transistor?

      <p class="theme-light">
        I may have started progressing a bit tardy but I was always fascinated by the idea of being a programmer. Although it was more of a romanticized idea of a programmer that I saw in movies or when I read about them in articles like some 14 y/o finding the biggest bug bounty on google's platform. When I actually fell into love with it was when I actually understood what it entailed. It wasn't all fast moving words across the screen while I mashed the keyboard left and right. It was the application of my critical thinking that led me to truly embrace it.
    </p>
    <p class="theme-light">Since then, I have been tinkering around a bit. Some of my minor projects are:
      <br>
      &#9658;  TinDog : A home page website which provides details of the application to the end user like the description of the website, from where we can download the application, a section that displays the feedback from the clients and different plans and subscriptions. 
      <br>
      &#9658;  Simon Game :   This simon game is created using js dom.
      <br>
      &#9658;  Omnifood Redesign : A full design of the original Omnifood website (fictional AI-based meal subscription service).
      <br>
    <p class="theme-light">
      Other than that, my past experience includes:
      <br>
      &#9658; Newsletter website At SFIT Alumni Association (College Committee).
